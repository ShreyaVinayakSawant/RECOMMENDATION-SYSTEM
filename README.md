Movie Recommendation System Project

Overview
This project is part of my internship with CodSoft, where I developed a movie recommendation system to suggest movies to users based on their preferences. The system uses content-based filtering techniques to provide personalized recommendations. Additionally, I developed a web application using Streamlit to make the recommendation system user-friendly and accessible.
